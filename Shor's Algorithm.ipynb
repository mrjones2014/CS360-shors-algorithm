    "# Shor's Algorithm\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "Although all integers have a unique breakdown of prime factors, finding those prime factors is thought to be a hard problem in computer science; in fact, most modern cyber security and encryption measures depend on the assumption that solving this problem for integers of a thousand or more digits is not feasibly possible <cite data-cite=\"6038973/5MJ5Z6XZ\"></cite>. However, in 1995, MIT professor Peter Shor presented a quantum algorithm (an algorithm that runs on a quantum computer) to solve the factoring problem in polynomial time. Shor's algorithm thus drastically changed the set of problems in computer science that can be considered feasible."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Shor's algorithm could potentially break nearly all modern cryptography. Most encryption schemes use a public & private key paradigm; each device has two keys (public and private key), and the public keys are exchanged between devices. The keys are generated such that data encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted using the private key. Since the keys must be mathematically related (often based on arithmetic involving prime factors), the private key can theoretically be calculated from the public key. However, finding the prime factors of an integer of a thousand digits or more becomes infeasible on a classical computer; thus, calculating the private key from the public key could take hundreds of years on a classical computer, depending on the encryption scheme used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for efficiently finding the prime factors of large integers, and thus calculating a private key from a public key could become a feasible problem in the near future. For this reason, it is important that software professionals prepare for the eventuality of accessible quantum computing. While theoretically effective post-quantum cryptography has been proposed, existing cyber security infrastructure (made up of classical computers) is not equipped to protect against attacks by a quantum computer."

    "### Using Period Finding Machine to Find Prime Factors\n",
    "Suppose a period finding machine is given that takes two co-prime integers $a$ and $N$ and outputs the period of $a\\mod N$. Then, the prime factors $p_1, p_2$ of $N$ can be found by the following procedure:\n",
    "1. Choose a random integer $a$ between $2..N-1$.\n",
    "2. Compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $a$ and $N$ (can be calculated efficiently using [Euclid's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm)); if this value is not equal to $1$, then it equals either $p_1$ or $p_2$, and the other can be computed from the found factor (e.g. $N/p_1$ or $N/p_2$). Otherwise, continue.\n",
    "3. Let $r$ be the period of $a\\mod N$; repeat steps 1-3 until $r$ is even. At this point, a value for $r$ has been found such that $a^r-1$ is a multiple of $N$.\n",
    "4. Consider the following identity:\n",
    "$$a^r-1=(a^{r/2}-1)(a^{r/2}+1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $a^{r/2}-1$ is not a multiple of $N$ (or else $r$ would equal $r/2$). If $a^{r/2}+1$ is a multiple of $N$, return to step 1. Otherwise, this means that neither of the values $a^{r/2}\\pm 1$ are multiples of $N$, but the product of these two values *is* a multiple of $N$. This is possible if and only if $p_1$ is a prime factor of $a^{r/2}-1$ and $p_2$ is a prime factor of $a^{r/2}+1$ or vice versa. Therefore, $p_1$ and $p_2$ can now be computed by $p_1=GCD(N, a^{r/2}-1)$ and $p_2=GCD(N, a^{r/2}+1)$.

    "### Using a Quantum Computer to Simulate Period Finding Machine \n",
    "The true power of Shor's algorithm lies in the ability of a quantum computer to simulate such a \"period finding machine\" required to efficiently solve the factoring problem. By exploiting quantum parallelism and constructive interference, certain \"global properties\" can be derived from a complex function. The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm uses this technique to determine if a function has the global property of being a balanced function <cite data-cite=\"6038973/JGE9DZ5X\"></cite>. In Shor's algorithm, it can be used to determine the periodicity of the modular exponentiation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose two co-prime integers $a$ and $N$ are given; the goal is to find the smallest possible integer $r$ such that $a^r=1\\pmod N$. A unitary operator $U_a$ can be constructed which implements the modular multiplication function such that $U_a: x\\rightarrow ax\\pmod N$. With this definition of $U_a$, it can be shown that the each Eigenvalue of $U_a$ is of the form $e^{i\\phi}$ where $\\phi=2\\pi k/r$ for some integer $k$ <cite data-cite=\"6038973/5MJ5Z6XZ\"></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvalues of a unitary operator can be efficiently measured using the quantum phase estimation algorithm <cite data-cite=\"6038973/MQPZCEWP\"></cite>. However, the value of $r$ can only be derived from a given Eigenvalue if the Eigenvalue is measured *exactly* or with exponentially small precision; for example, a factorization of a $1000$ digit integer would require an Eigenvalue measured with a precision of $10^{-2000}$ <cite data-cite=\"6038973/5MJ5Z6XZ\"></cite>. Such a level of precision cannot be achieved using the phase estimation algorithm because it would require too large a pointer system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, define a family of unitary operators $U_b$ with $b=a, a^2, a^4, a^8,\\dots a^{2^P}$ where $P\\approx N^2$. Notice that all $U_b$ are integer powers of $U_a$; thus, if $b=a^t$ for some integer $t$, then $U_b=(U_a)^t$, which implies that all $U_b$ have the same Eigenvectors as $U_a$. Further, this means that the Eigenvalues of all $U_b$ can be derived simultaneously. Additionally, the implementation of $U_b$ is as easy as implementing $U_a$; simply pre-compute the powers of $U_a$ by repeated squaring method. Conveniently, each squaring of $a$ reduces the margin of error in the estimation of $U_a$ by a factor of $1/_2$; this mitigates the requirement for exact or exponentially small precision in the phase estimation algorithm. For example, a precision of $10^{-2000}$ can be achieved by a series of $10^6$ less precise measurements (up to 10% error) of $U_b$, and selecting a few Eigenvalues $\\phi=2\\pi k/r$ at random to estimate with a precision of $1/N^2$ is enough to derive an exact value of $r$ using rational approximation to estimate $k/r$ <cite data-cite=\"6038973/5MJ5Z6XZ\"></cite>."

That is, the number of input wires must equal the number of output wires for each gate. Further, the classical subroutine can use scratch memory for local variables, but the scratch memory must be wiped clean upon termination of the subroutine; leaving residual values in the scratch memory could potentially destroy quantum coherence, preventing the quantum routine from being able to detect interference between quantum states <cite data-cite=\"6038973/5MJ5Z6XZ\"></cite>.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Shor's algorithm is perhaps the most radical example of how quantum computing has changed (and can continue to change) the set of problems considered feasible. In the past, prime factorization was a problem considered so infeasible that a significant portion of existing cryptography infrastructure is based on this assumption; this means that quantum computing technology, along with Shor's algorithm, could be used to crack nearly any common encryption used today. Shor's algorithm is on the bleeding edge of quantum computing; as quantum computing technology has gained traction in recent years, it has been used as a sort of litmus test for quantum computer viability. IBM first demonstrated a simple implementation of Shor's algorithm on one of their early quantum computers in 2001, factorizing the number 15 into its factors 3 and 5 <cite data-cite=\"6038973/JAVDPU78\"></cite>. Significant progress has been made since 2001 in the realm of quantum computing technology, and for this reason, its important to begin considering it as an inevitability which will come to fruition sooner rather than later."
